# Progress
Update blog to post my progress throughout learning how to code and becoming a data scientist/engineer

## Progress until 11/10 and Future Plans

Hello future me. I began learning python in July 2024, a couple months after I graduated college. Data is something that fascinates me and I really wanted to make something of myself in the data world within my industry of chemical engineering. So I began to take the CS50P class from Harvard University and it took me a while to complete. I was distracted from trying to find a job in this grueling market and also hanging out with friends and enjoying my last months before working in the real world.

Day by day, I slowly coded little by little and I didn't find much progress/success. I found myself focusing more on getting a job then the whole coding thing, which has been an issue within myself from committing to habits. But after I found a job and moved down to Richmond, VA for work, I slowly acccumulated more and more free time since I was living in a new city with nobody to talk to.

After realizing that, I started to pick up coding again, and completed the CS50P course. I did all the problems sets within the lessons, and they took me a long time to complete. My method while watching the lectures was the following: 

1. Take notes and pause the video when trying to read/understand the code
2. Rewatch a clip of what Dr. Malan said to really grasp the concept
3. After finishing the lecture, taking time to tackle the problem sets even though they took me hours at hand

After finishing CS50P, I began to watch a lot of python videos just on different techniques that build off of what I learned. And after a little while, I started to research different roadmaps to how I can become a data scientist. The main skills that I found that I should be learning were Python, Pandas, SQL, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Excel, and Tableau. To me, all of these seemed reasonable because I have a backround in engineering and already have mastered problem solving at hand. For me, the difficult part was teaching myself everything within a certain time frame.

I felt like I knew python well and understood the language better than most beginners just because I've already learned how to problem solve, so that's why I skipped doing small python projects and went straight to pandas. I found Luke Barousse's Data Analytics in Python video on YouTube, and went through that pretty quickly while applying the same method I did with CS50P: stopping the video to understand/grasp concepts, doing example problems, and reading over code to understand what I'm actually writing.

Now, the next steps is to practice more with pandas and apply my knowledge with datasets from Kaggle and practice this business mindset of grabbing data from somewhere (Kaggle), processing it, cleaning it, and getting insights from it. That is what's in store for the next month so I can get a really good sense of data analysis with Python.

After that, my next steps are learning SQL, and this is my roadmap for that:

1. sqlbolt.com (first 12 free lessons)
2. DataLemurs 30+ free intro + intermediate SQL tutorials
3. Intermediate lessons on mode.com SQL tutorials
4. Danny Ma's 8 week SQL Challenge
5. 60+ real SQL Interview Questions

After doing that, I will start projects with getting data using SQL and then analyzing it with pandas/python/matplotlib. That is the plan for now, and I expect to be done with all of that around February/March, depending on how long I want to spend doing side projects and really implementing what I learn from tutorial hell.

Then, to stretch out much further, I will begin machine learning and start with fundamentals of statistics. Back to the basics. I will practically take a statistics course and learn all the advanced statistics techniques/methods until it really implements into my brain. Then to add to that, maybe some Linear Algebra but only the important topics. After that, which should take probably about a month of two, I will take the Machine Learning course from Harvard University as the first steps to learning. I have accumulated so many Machine Learning resources so far so all I need to do is go through them and see what I can make of this. There is so much to learn with Machine Learning, but I promise to start that next year no later than July 2025. I need to give myself time to learn statistics beforehand since that is the barebones of Machine Learning.

I will keep this blog updated weekly/monthly (whenever I remember) and see my progress grow into something I can be proud of.

# Progress 12/10

So this past month has been great for learning, especially with data analysis. I found more and more resources on different datasets and learning opportunities, such as Datawars, Kaggle, and different GitHub repos that have weekly datasets with business questions tied into them. Slowly but surely I am chugging along, but I don't want to rush things. I know I said I should be going into SQL atleast by the end of the month, but I'm not sure if I will get there. It all depends on my motivation during the holidays and throughout the new year, but I will try and make it a priority everyday to practce atleast an hour since I will have a bunch of free time at home.

Otherwise, I am pretty confident with using beginnger pandas techniques and plenty of graphing techniques, but now I want to focus on groupby, pivot tables, and hammer down different seaborn graphing methods with unique datasets. After being comfortable with up to an intermediate-ish level of all of that, then I will continue onto SQL (hopefully by the beginning of the new year). I will check back in with the new year and give my short term and long term goals that I hope to achieve throughout the new year.

# Progress 1/6

It's a brand new year and I am ready to continue my coding journey. Over the break, I didn't get as much coding done as I wanted, but that is okay since I spent a lot of the time catching up with friends and family which is more important to me. After some thinking, I developed a couple of coding goals for 2025. One of them is to be able to have learned enough information to apply for a data analyst/scientist job by the end of the year. I want to have a more than intermediate understanding of SQL, and a pretty good understanding of machine learning techniques. The second big goal is to find ways to apply my coding knowledge into my job. Since I am rotating out of project engineering into the lab, I feel like there are so many data opportunities there and I can try and apply the things that I am learning with SQL and maybe even machine learning later on to the data provided in the lab.

As of where I am at coding wise, I just finished my pandas journey today (1/9) and I believe I have a solid understanding of data cleaning and data visualization using matplotlib. I know how to use the bulk of pandas but I don't understand the unique functions that aren't necessary day to day. I can do the job of someone grabbing data, cleaning it, and doing an EDA for most datasets. I did a bunch of practice with datasets on DataWars, and I will go back to pandas stuff after I get a great understanding of SQL.

As for SQL, I am ready to begin and the first steps I will take is to follow DataLemur's 30 day SQL roadmap but take it slower to try and understand it more. I found some good websites that have plenty of resources, so I am not too worried about running out of information. Then after I get through most of these websites, I can start watching some YouTube videos on SQL practice problems/interview questions. I have another website called Stratascratch and it has a bunch of SQL interview questions (also DataLemur too), so that will be something I can practice for a while after I get a really good understanding of the language. And also, I can try and apply the language to my job too with some smart P&ID option that somebody was mentioning that my company had a while back.

I know I said before in this progress journal that I should be done with SQL by February/March. This is definitely possible if I keep at it everyday just for atleast an hour. Some days I might spend more time because it's interesting to me, but other days I might just skip it since I am focusing on other things.

I will update back in a couple of weeks so I can get the hang of things with SQL and see how I feel about the language, how easy/hard is it to learn, and what I think my progress might be in the future. I am only saying that because I've mentioned before that I understood pandas pretty quick just from a coding standpoint because of my knowledge in problem solving as an engineer, so I am curious as to what the SQL language is like. Also, I am learning how to implement Git more, so I will be learning about that before I start SQL. I believe Git is a good foundation on keeping my progress throughout learning code.

# Progress 1/26

I am a few weeks into learning SQL and it has been going by very fast. I have finished all the intermediate lessons with DataLemur and Mode, and finished SQLBolt up to Lesson 12 based on DataLemur's 30 day roadmap for SQL. Now, starting on 1/27, I am beginning the advanvced section of SQL starting with Mode, then moving on to DataLemur. I tried looking at Danny's 8 week SQL challenge, but it seemed too difficult without knowing the advanced features of SQL. So I am beginning that and so far I really like SQL. It's definitely significantly different compared to pandas, and pandas can do a lot more with easier functionality in my opinion, but the SQL notation is quick to understand.

The websites I found, DataLemur and Mode, are really good learning wise since they provide examples that are relevant to the lesson and use real world examples. They also make you think and aren't direct copies from the lesson. So for these advanced lessons, I will really try and focus on understanding the material and take my time on the practice problems. Using my knowledge of problem solving will really help and also trigger my brain to learn quicker since it is struggling more and thinking rather than just copying down answers.

For the future of my SQL roadmap, I believe my February/March date of being somewhat finished with SQL is reasonable because I've been putting good time into coding. Some days at work aren't that busy, so I take advantage of that and code on the side. After learning these advanced topics, I am really going to take my time doing practice examples and looking at real life examples that data scientists do in their day to day jobs using SQL. I have some YouTube videos saved in my watch later that I will take a look at after I finish the lessons on the two websites mentioned above. Also, after the lessons are over, I will take a quick break and learn Git, so I can use VS Code to track my SQL learning when doing practice problems.

I am excited to learn more about SQL and how it could potentially apply to my job right now. My motivation is still high on learning how to code and I am eager to move on to machine learning, where in my opinion might be the stepping stone to bigger things in the future regarding my career goals.

One big thing I want to mention to end my what is turning to be monthly checkups is that I am proud of what I have accomplished so far. In the beginning of this journey, back in July 2024, I really got caught up in reading reddit salaries and what people need to do to become a data scientist. The biggest thing was that I was reading a lot but never taking action. I need to learn this and that, this is how much I could be making, these websites are what people recommend... on and on and on until I just closed my computer and did the same thing the next day. But I believe when I moved down to Richmond, I really took matters into my own hands and committed to it. I avoided tutorial hell and endless scrolling of data salaries and roadmaps, and made something of myself. And now, I know a whole coding language and a big library within it, and am learning a second one with heaping amounts of motivation to get through it and learn more. I am proud of stepping up and fixing things in my life that I didn't think were easy to fix, and I wholeheartedly believe that if I didn't take this job in Richmond, none of this would be happening right now. So to that, I say let's go learn some more SQL.

# Progress 2/13

It has been 2-3 weeks since my last update and I thought I would come back and update myself on my progress so far. I said that I would be beginning advanced functions in SQL and I am close to being done with them. I have one more day with DataLemur and then I can move onto Danny's 8 weeks of SQL challenge, which I hope to get done in less than a week. For that challenge, I am really going to test my skills and not rely on answer keys to understand what I am writing. I will go step by step into each query I write to fully grasp the concept.

But regarding the advanced functions in SQL, they aren't too difficult content-wise, but trying to understand practice problems right away and applying what I already know is a bit challenging. There are multiple answers for one query, and trying to decide which one to use is definitely a challenge. I'm currently having difficulty understanding when and when not to use window functions, but slowly but surely I will get there and understand the difference. Right now, I believe it's just if I want to show the rows that I am grouping by or not into the output query, but I'll keep at it and come back in the next update with a better explanation.

I am still highly motivated to write more SQL code and maintain this roadmap that I have. After I get through Danny's challenge, I saved an 11 hour YouTube video that works in BigQuery and Google Cloud Console with SQL, which I am going to go through since I can potentially apply this stuff to my job since we work with Google. That is my current plan and I've told myself not to get ahead and plan things that I "think" I am going to do in the next couple of months. I don't want to rush things and I want to grasp them fully. I even sometimes catch myself going back to basic python code since I get things stuck in my head at random points of the day. Then I open VS Code, and write some short python lines to explain what I'm thinking in my head.

One other small thing to mention is that I can feel myself holding back on really putting in hours into this. After work, I eat dinner, go to the gym, then have a lot of time to code and look at things (about 3-4 hours), but some days I am just lazy and want to watch YouTube and play Hay Day on my phone - basically distracting myself from doing what I should be doing. But often times I think that distracting my brain and relaxing it might be good for me, and I try not to stress it too much. I've kept a tracker of my social media intake from screentime and it is for sure decreasing from the day I started tracking it (January 1st, 2025). Eventually, I want to remove that urge to go on my phone after I come home from the gym and work on things that will better myself for the future.

Finally, I am still happy as to where I'm at in life. I talked to my college roommate about how this process takes time and some day I will be where I hope to be as a result of all this hard work. So that is my motivation. Work my ass off until I can say I did it. Where I can say I am proud of myself. Where I can prove to myself that even doing the smallest amount day by day will eventually bring you to the finish line. The finish line might be years away, but the only thing I'm focused on is tomorrow.

Well, that's enough for this update. Just got to keep chugging along. Next update in two weeks probably.

# Progress 3/3

Two and a half weeks has passed and I would say a good amount of progress has been completed. I finished the advanced learning part of SQL and have been digging into interview problems as a way of problem solving. I tried out Danny's 8 week challenge, but it seemed like it was just a lot of practice with the same dataset and repetitive tasks to the point that I didn't feel like I was learning anything. I've been doing interview question practice on DataLemur, and am almost done with the medium problems. After I get done with the hard problems, which should be quite soon, then I think I've decided to end my SQL learning for now. I believe I have a good understanding of the lamguage to where I can query what I want, and I don't want to overdue it right now since I don't have any actual experience in the field. Maybe I should start looking up different volunteer opportunities to use SQL in the real world to get more hands on experience, but that isn't something with high priority.

Next, I've got two things to watch/take notes on. First, is a statistics textbook that has a video series tied along with it from Stanford. After going through that and taking notes either on VS Code or just typed notes in a word document, I will take the CS50 Artificial Intelligence with Python course. Then, from there, Andrew Ngs machine learning course that's offered on coursera (I believe), and that is where my machine learning journey will begin.

I definitely want to refresh myself on python by going back into my notes from my intial CS50 Python course and get down all the things I forgot about that aren't just the basics. Also, I want to take that 4 hour git course that I've been holding off on so I can update my Github when learning Machine Learning. I feel like this is a big next step towards my future and it should be documented.

Timeline-wise, I am still on time with what I predicted -- being done with SQL by February/March. I don't think I rushed the process at all since the SQL lamguage isn't too difficult in itself, and I am proud of everything I've learned and the time I put into this. This will be a common theme for this journal because I really want to make myself feel that all of this is worth it, and some self hype never hurts to get towards an ambitious goal at the end of all of this.

Well, there isn't much else to update on. I guess I'll be back in another couple of weeks, which will be right before I go on my big trip to Japan and take a couple week hiatus off of coding as a whole.

# Progress 3/9

Not sure why I am updating on here, but I feel like it's better to give my thoughts weekly if I have something to say. I decided that I should be getting a better understanding with date functions since it'll apply well when I return back to pandas/python. Since I've learned joins really well, all of that can translate over and I'm excited to see how I can use join functions in pandas. But for the time being, I'm back on the Datawars website (one I used for matplotlib and pandas previously) to work on date functions and simple querying with joins/subqueries. I'll probably do some more practice with this for this week then watch the Git video before I head on my trip.

Once I can fully grasp date functions and apply them however I want, I feel like that will be a good stopping point for SQL and begin my journey with Machine Learning. As I said before in the last progress update, I will start to watch YouTube videos from the Standford statistics class then watch the CS50 AI with Python course. After that, Andrew Ng's course on machine learning then go through the resources I've collected from the past 7 months.

Also, something really exciting is that I found out that I can use SQL in my job. I will slowly but surely figure out some "ETL", if you even want to describe it as that, to extract information from SAP, clean it in python/pandas, and somehow export it to google cloud and get it into our design program sheets. This will help the applications team make better budgets for projects and this could potentially lead to more bids since they will have a more accurate number. Some NS Clarifier projects had budgets way over and this could be crucial since if we had the price half a million less, then we would be better contenders from the beginning when winning a project. I'm eager to continue this process and see what value I can provide.

Excited for the journey to continue. It feels like it just got started but I've learned so much already. See you next progress check right before my big 2 week trip.

# Progress 3/21

Well here it is, the progress check right before my big trip and biggest hiatus I've taken with coding since the holidays in December/January. Currently, I am learning how to use Git in the terminal and also through GitHub. I have finished part 1 of the course and now on part 2, looking forward to possibly complete it today (2 hours remaining). I think it will definitely benefit knowing how to use it when learning machine learning because I believe I will be on VS Code a lot.

I know I mentioned my path/roadmap for machine learning in the last progress check, but here is a more definitive list of how I'm going to tackle this:

1. Watch Introduction to Statistics video playlist saved by StatQuest with Josh Starmer to get a good recap of fundamental statistics that I learned in college/high school
2. Watch the introduction to statistics video playlist from Stanford which covers the Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISL) textbook which is fundamental to machine learning
3. Do the CS50 AI with Python course from Harvard
4. Do Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course as the last good reference to machine learning even though it might be repetitive (heard this is one of the best courses out there)

After doing all of these, I believe I will have a good stance on the machine learning topics to where I can stard making projects. I know I have a ton of videos saved in my watch later, so I can go through some of those if they deem appropriate. I've got too many in there and I need to remove them one by one since most of them are basic tutorials.

I am giving myself atleast 3-4 months to learn this stuff. Target end date will be around the end of July. This is where I need to put in the effort and really learn because this is the foundation of jobs like being a data scientist or analyst. My goal is to take better notes and really attempt to do problems without any assistance. Studying just how I did in school is the best method to learn, and starting at a problem for hours will help me with that. I need to find that motivation to stick with it and not give up, and after coming back from Japan it is going to be difficult.

Coming back from such a high of a trip will bring my dopamine receptors down since I will be seeking this high when it won't be there anymore, so a couple of off days doing nothing is important before starting this big task.

After machine learning stuff, I will focus on data visualization with Tableau, which won't take long, and bring everything together with real world applications. Then, if I'm comfortable with everything and can do interview questions with ease, the job hunt may begin. I don't want to get ahead of myself though, since it takes hard work and discipline to get there. So far I've done good, and I am still very excited for the future. I will come back with an update after my trip to do a small recap on my mindset going into machine learning.

That's all for now. See you in 2 weeks.

#Progress 4/14

Vacation to Japan was quite the trip. I'm glad I took a long break without thinking about coding for a while so I can put my mind in a relaxing mode without worrying about keeping up with learning new things. I did review Python code that I've done with the CS50P course and practice problems just for sinmple review, but nothing major. I also completed the Git course and have a good understanding of how Git works. I will start using it and maybe even learn Vim if I think it'll be useful in the long run whenever I begin using VS Code for machine learning problems.

One thing I learned about my trip was that it is better to live in the moment and enjoy the present rather than being updated on what's going on in the social media world. I connected with a lot of people on the street, at a bar, and even my best friend by asking vulnerable questions that I wouldn't typically ask the average human, and I'm glad I did. Also, I learned a lot about myself as a human. I realized that I can get arrogant sometimes when portraying my sarcasm and when people aren't in the best of moods, I should be comforting and understanding rather than try and make a joke to laugh it off because most of the time they don't want to hear that in the moment. It's better to show the person that you support them and are here for them rather than being sarcastic and not having any empathy for them. Another thing that I learned about myself was that I should think a little bit more before I act, because I tend to make a decision that I'm not 100% about. Think about the pros and cons, talk to people close to you, and understand the true reason why I go one way versus the other, because I don't want to be wasting my time thinking that I made the wrong decision in the long run since time is too valuable.

Okay, enough about the life lessons learned in Japan. Here is where I'm at now:
I am currently watching the Introduction to Statistics video by StatQuest with Josh Starmer and I am taking notes on things that I think would be important in the long run. I roughly calculated that there is 8 hours of video material, but with the pausing and note taking, I'm expecting that to be longer by a couple of hours atleast. Then, as I mentioned in the last progress check, I will watch the stanford statistics video, do CS50 AI with Python, then Andrew Ng's machine learning course. I'm excited to learn this new material and am motivated to do so since I have time at work and time at home as well after work.

And something big that I'm even more excited about is implenenting my SQL knowledge at work with SAP. I know I mentioned it before that there might be a possibility of this happening, and now that I requested access to SAP and will hopefully get it next week, I will put my main focus on that during work whenever I have free time (which is most of the time), and help my coworker Patrick improve his design program by exporting prices in a neat format. There has to be a way of exporting SAP to google sheets, but currently I only know how to do it with Excel. Maybe there is a method to creating a workflow/pipeline of data to get the right numbers in the right place, but lots of research and trial and error will go on to figure out something that will work in the long run. I am very excited to try this out because I tryly believe that this will be the beginning of my journey into the data world/transition into talking with more people in that field to give me the best opportunities in the future.

That is this progress check. I will check back in whenever I feel that it's necessary. Toodaloo.
