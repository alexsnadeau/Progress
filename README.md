# Progress
Update blog to post my progress throughout learning how to code and becoming a data scientist/engineer

## Progress until 11/11 and Future Plans

Hello future me. I began learning python in June 2024, a month after I graduated college. Data is something that fascinates me and I really wanted to make something of myself in the data world within my industry of chemical engineering. So I began to take the CS50P class from Harvard University and it took me a while to complete. I was distracted from trying to find a job in this grueling market and also hanging out with friends and enjoying my last months before working in the real world.

Day by day, I slowly coded little by little and I didn't find much progress/success. I found myself focusing more on getting a job then the whole coding thing, which has been an issue within myself from committing to habits. But after I found a job and moved down to Richmond, VA for work, I slowly acccumulated more and more free time since I was living in a new city with nobody to talk to.

After realizing that, I started to pick up coding again, and completed the CS50P course. I did all the problems sets within the lessons, and they took me a long time to complete. My method while watching the lectures was this: 

1. Take notes and pause the video when trying to read/understand the code
2. Rewatch a clip of what Dr. Malan said to really grasp the concept
3. After finishing the lecture, taking time to tackle the problem sets even though they took me hours at hand

After finishing CS50P, I began to watch a lot of python videos just on different techniques that build off of what I learned. And after a little while, I started to research different roadmaps to how I can become a data scientist. The main skills that I found that I should be learning were Python, Pandas, SQL, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Excel, and Tableau. To me, all of these seemed reasonable because I have a backround in engineering and already have mastered problem solving at hand. For me, the difficult part was teaching myself everything within a certain time frame.

I felt like I knew python well and understood the language better than most just because I've already learned how to problem solve, so that's why I skipped doing small python projects and went straight to pandas. I found Luke Barousse's Data Analytics in Python video on YouTube, and wen through that pretty quickly while applying the same method I did with CS50P: stopping the video to understand/grasp concepts, doing example problems, and reading over code to understand what I'm actually writing.

Now, the next steps is to practice more with pandas and apply my knowledge with datasets from Kaggle and practice this business mindset of grabbing data from somewhere (Kaggle), processing it, cleaning it, and getting insights from it. That is what's in store for the next month so I can get a really good sense of data analysis with Python.

After that, my next steps are learning SQL, and this is my roadmap for that:

1. sqlbolt.com (first 12 free lessons)
2. DataLemurs 30+ free intro + intermediate SQL tutorials
3. Intermediate lessons on mode.com SQL tutorials
4. Danny Ma's 8 week SQL Challenge
5. 60+ real SQL Interview Questions

After doing that, I will start projects with getting data using SQL and then analyzing it with pandas/python/matplotlib. That is the plan for now, and I expect to be done with all of that around February/March, depending on how long I want to spend doing side projects and really implementing what I learn from tutorial hell.

Then, to stretch out much further, I will begin machine learning and start with the Machine Learning course from Harvard University. There is so much to learn with Machine Learning, but I promise to start that next year no later than March.

I will keep this blog updated weekly and see my progress grow into something I can be proud of.
