Update blog to post my progress throughout learning how to code and becoming a data scientist/engineer

## Progress until 11/10 and Future Plans

Hello future me. I began learning python in July 2024, a couple months after I graduated college. Data is something that fascinates me and I really wanted to make something of myself in the data world within my industry of chemical engineering. So I began to take the CS50P class from Harvard University and it took me a while to complete. I was distracted from trying to find a job in this grueling market and also hanging out with friends and enjoying my last months before working in the real world.

Day by day, I slowly coded little by little and I didn't find much progress/success. I found myself focusing more on getting a job then the whole coding thing, which has been an issue within myself from committing to habits. But after I found a job and moved down to Richmond, VA for work, I slowly acccumulated more and more free time since I was living in a new city with nobody to talk to.

After realizing that, I started to pick up coding again, and completed the CS50P course. I did all the problems sets within the lessons, and they took me a long time to complete. My method while watching the lectures was the following: 

1. Take notes and pause the video when trying to read/understand the code
2. Rewatch a clip of what Dr. Malan said to really grasp the concept
3. After finishing the lecture, taking time to tackle the problem sets even though they took me hours at hand

After finishing CS50P, I began to watch a lot of python videos just on different techniques that build off of what I learned. And after a little while, I started to research different roadmaps to how I can become a data scientist. The main skills that I found that I should be learning were Python, Pandas, SQL, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Excel, and Tableau. To me, all of these seemed reasonable because I have a backround in engineering and already have mastered problem solving at hand. For me, the difficult part was teaching myself everything within a certain time frame.

I felt like I knew python well and understood the language better than most beginners just because I've already learned how to problem solve, so that's why I skipped doing small python projects and went straight to pandas. I found Luke Barousse's Data Analytics in Python video on YouTube, and went through that pretty quickly while applying the same method I did with CS50P: stopping the video to understand/grasp concepts, doing example problems, and reading over code to understand what I'm actually writing.

Now, the next steps is to practice more with pandas and apply my knowledge with datasets from Kaggle and practice this business mindset of grabbing data from somewhere (Kaggle), processing it, cleaning it, and getting insights from it. That is what's in store for the next month so I can get a really good sense of data analysis with Python.

After that, my next steps are learning SQL, and this is my roadmap for that:

1. sqlbolt.com (first 12 free lessons)
2. DataLemurs 30+ free intro + intermediate SQL tutorials
3. Intermediate lessons on mode.com SQL tutorials
4. Danny Ma's 8 week SQL Challenge
5. 60+ real SQL Interview Questions

After doing that, I will start projects with getting data using SQL and then analyzing it with pandas/python/matplotlib. That is the plan for now, and I expect to be done with all of that around February/March, depending on how long I want to spend doing side projects and really implementing what I learn from tutorial hell.

Then, to stretch out much further, I will begin machine learning and start with fundamentals of statistics. Back to the basics. I will practically take a statistics course and learn all the advanced statistics techniques/methods until it really implements into my brain. Then to add to that, maybe some Linear Algebra but only the important topics. After that, which should take probably about a month of two, I will take the Machine Learning course from Harvard University as the first steps to learning. I have accumulated so many Machine Learning resources so far so all I need to do is go through them and see what I can make of this. There is so much to learn with Machine Learning, but I promise to start that next year no later than July 2025. I need to give myself time to learn statistics beforehand since that is the barebones of Machine Learning.

I will keep this blog updated weekly/monthly (whenever I remember) and see my progress grow into something I can be proud of.

# Progress 12/10

So this past month has been great for learning, especially with data analysis. I found more and more resources on different datasets and learning opportunities, such as Datawars, Kaggle, and different GitHub repos that have weekly datasets with business questions tied into them. Slowly but surely I am chugging along, but I don't want to rush things. I know I said I should be going into SQL atleast by the end of the month, but I'm not sure if I will get there. It all depends on my motivation during the holidays and throughout the new year, but I will try and make it a priority everyday to practce atleast an hour since I will have a bunch of free time at home.

Otherwise, I am pretty confident with using beginnger pandas techniques and plenty of graphing techniques, but now I want to focus on groupby, pivot tables, and hammer down different seaborn graphing methods with unique datasets. After being comfortable with up to an intermediate-ish level of all of that, then I will continue onto SQL (hopefully by the beginning of the new year). I will check back in with the new year and give my short term and long term goals that I hope to achieve throughout the new year.

# Progress 1/6

It's a brand new year and I am ready to continue my coding journey. Over the break, I didn't get as much coding done as I wanted, but that is okay since I spent a lot of the time catching up with friends and family which is more important to me. After some thinking, I developed a couple of coding goals for 2025. One of them is to be able to have learned enough information to apply for a data analyst/scientist job by the end of the year. I want to have a more than intermediate understanding of SQL, and a pretty good understanding of machine learning techniques. The second big goal is to find ways to apply my coding knowledge into my job. Since I am rotating out of project engineering into the lab, I feel like there are so many data opportunities there and I can try and apply the things that I am learning with SQL and maybe even machine learning later on to the data provided in the lab.

As of where I am at coding wise, I just finished my pandas journey today (1/9) and I believe I have a solid understanding of data cleaning and data visualization using matplotlib. I know how to use the bulk of pandas but I don't understand the unique functions that aren't necessary day to day. I can do the job of someone grabbing data, cleaning it, and doing an EDA for most datasets. I did a bunch of practice with datasets on DataWars, and I will go back to pandas stuff after I get a great understanding of SQL.

As for SQL, I am ready to begin and the first steps I will take is to follow DataLemur's 30 day SQL roadmap but take it slower to try and understand it more. I found some good websites that have plenty of resources, so I am not too worried about running out of information. Then after I get through most of these websites, I can start watching some YouTube videos on SQL practice problems/interview questions. I have another website called Stratascratch and it has a bunch of SQL interview questions (also DataLemur too), so that will be something I can practice for a while after I get a really good understanding of the language. And also, I can try and apply the language to my job too with some smart P&ID option that somebody was mentioning that my company had a while back.

I know I said before in this progress journal that I should be done with SQL by February/March. This is definitely possible if I keep at it everyday just for atleast an hour. Some days I might spend more time because it's interesting to me, but other days I might just skip it since I am focusing on other things.

I will update back in a couple of weeks so I can get the hang of things with SQL and see how I feel about the language, how easy/hard is it to learn, and what I think my progress might be in the future. I am only saying that because I've mentioned before that I understood pandas pretty quick just from a coding standpoint because of my knowledge in problem solving as an engineer, so I am curious as to what the SQL language is like. Also, I am learning how to implement Git more, so I will be learning about that before I start SQL. I believe Git is a good foundation on keeping my progress throughout learning code.

# Progress 1/26

I am a few weeks into learning SQL and it has been going by very fast. I have finished all the intermediate lessons with DataLemur and Mode, and finished SQLBolt up to Lesson 12 based on DataLemur's 30 day roadmap for SQL. Now, starting on 1/27, I am beginning the advanvced section of SQL starting with Mode, then moving on to DataLemur. I tried looking at Danny's 8 week SQL challenge, but it seemed too difficult without knowing the advanced features of SQL. So I am beginning that and so far I really like SQL. It's definitely significantly different compared to pandas, and pandas can do a lot more with easier functionality in my opinion, but the SQL notation is quick to understand.

The websites I found, DataLemur and Mode, are really good learning wise since they provide examples that are relevant to the lesson and use real world examples. They also make you think and aren't direct copies from the lesson. So for these advanced lessons, I will really try and focus on understanding the material and take my time on the practice problems. Using my knowledge of problem solving will really help and also trigger my brain to learn quicker since it is struggling more and thinking rather than just copying down answers.

For the future of my SQL roadmap, I believe my February/March date of being somewhat finished with SQL is reasonable because I've been putting good time into coding. Some days at work aren't that busy, so I take advantage of that and code on the side. After learning these advanced topics, I am really going to take my time doing practice examples and looking at real life examples that data scientists do in their day to day jobs using SQL. I have some YouTube videos saved in my watch later that I will take a look at after I finish the lessons on the two websites mentioned above. Also, after the lessons are over, I will take a quick break and learn Git, so I can use VS Code to track my SQL learning when doing practice problems.

I am excited to learn more about SQL and how it could potentially apply to my job right now. My motivation is still high on learning how to code and I am eager to move on to machine learning, where in my opinion might be the stepping stone to bigger things in the future regarding my career goals.

One big thing I want to mention to end my what is turning to be monthly checkups is that I am proud of what I have accomplished so far. In the beginning of this journey, back in July 2024, I really got caught up in reading reddit salaries and what people need to do to become a data scientist. The biggest thing was that I was reading a lot but never taking action. I need to learn this and that, this is how much I could be making, these websites are what people recommend... on and on and on until I just closed my computer and did the same thing the next day. But I believe when I moved down to Richmond, I really took matters into my own hands and committed to it. I avoided tutorial hell and endless scrolling of data salaries and roadmaps, and made something of myself. And now, I know a whole coding language and a big library within it, and am learning a second one with heaping amounts of motivation to get through it and learn more. I am proud of stepping up and fixing things in my life that I didn't think were easy to fix, and I wholeheartedly believe that if I didn't take this job in Richmond, none of this would be happening right now. So to that, I say let's go learn some more SQL.
